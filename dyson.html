				<a href="#00:00:0.00" id="00:00:0.00" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(0, this.id)">So then I come to Cambridge in 1941 as a 17-year-old, and I'd always been interested in physics</a>
				<a href="#00:00:10.94" id="00:00:10.94" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(10, this.id)">and applied mathematics of all sorts, and one of the textbooks that I bought as a prize</a>
				<a href="#00:00:15.96" id="00:00:15.96" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(15, this.id)">was a textbook in aerodynamics, which I think was because of James Lighthill, and so I thought</a>
				<a href="#00:00:24.38" id="00:00:24.38" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(24, this.id)">of myself as becoming an aerodynamicist as a serious possibility. That seemed to be a</a>
				<a href="#00:00:30.72" id="00:00:30.72" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(30, this.id)">field where mathematics could really be helpful, and flying, of course, was exciting. But anyway,</a>
				<a href="#00:00:37.46" id="00:00:37.46" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(37, this.id)">I arrived in Cambridge, and all the applied mathematicians were gone. There was nobody</a>
				<a href="#00:00:42.40" id="00:00:42.40" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(42, this.id)">there except pure, and all the applied mathematicians and physicists were fighting the war, and</a>
				<a href="#00:00:50.28" id="00:00:50.28" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(50, this.id)">they had gone to do radar or cryptoanalysis or various other things. So they had all disappeared,</a>
				<a href="#00:01:0.84" id="00:01:0.84" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(60, this.id)">and all that was left was the pure mathematicians. So I just had a wonderful feast of pure mathematics</a>
				<a href="#00:01:6.32" id="00:01:6.32" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(66, this.id)">for the two years that I was in Cambridge, and I had the great luck to have Bezikovich</a>
				<a href="#00:01:12.76" id="00:01:12.76" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(72, this.id)">as my tutor, who was a great mathematician as well as being also a Russian, so I could</a>
				<a href="#00:01:20.42" id="00:01:20.42" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(80, this.id)">talk Russian with him, and we became very close friends. With him, I actually did serious</a>
				<a href="#00:01:29.12" id="00:01:29.12" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(89, this.id)">mathematics, and I got, again, deep into problems which I never solved but which gave me enormous</a>
				<a href="#00:01:42.68" id="00:01:42.68" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(102, this.id)">satisfaction. I remember Bezikovich gave me problems which would have been too hard for</a>
				<a href="#00:01:50.16" id="00:01:50.16" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(110, this.id)">a graduate student, but nevertheless, they taught me a tremendous lot.</a>

				<a href="#00:01:56.27" id="00:01:56.27" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(116, this.id)">And he was primarily interested in measure theory and such problems?</a>

				<a href="#00:02:1.73" id="00:02:1.73" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(121, this.id)">Yes, he was also geometry, but it was metrical geometry rather than algebraic. But the kind</a>
				<a href="#00:02:9.63" id="00:02:9.63" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(129, this.id)">of problem he gave to me was to understand the properties of measurable sets in fractional</a>
				<a href="#00:02:18.85" id="00:02:18.85" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(138, this.id)">dimensions. It's hard enough in one dimension or two, but when you come to fractional dimensions</a>
				<a href="#00:02:27.51" id="00:02:27.51" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(147, this.id)">it gets worse. So I had a great time struggling with that, but of course nothing much came</a>
				<a href="#00:02:34.38" id="00:02:34.38" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(154, this.id)">out of it except just a taste for his style. And Besicovitch's style has stayed with me</a>
				<a href="#00:02:41.16" id="00:02:41.16" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(161, this.id)">all my life. It's the way I do science in all fields. It's a very distinctive style,</a>
				<a href="#00:02:51.78" id="00:02:51.78" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(171, this.id)">which is kind of an architectural style in which you take very simple components and</a>
				<a href="#00:02:59.38" id="00:02:59.38" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(179, this.id)">then build hierarchical structures which become, stage by stage, bigger and fewer as you build</a>
				<a href="#00:03:12.77" id="00:03:12.77" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(192, this.id)">one story on another until finally you get the keystone at the top. So you have this</a>
				<a href="#00:03:17.85" id="00:03:17.85" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(197, this.id)">hierarchical structure which played a big part in all Besicovitch's work. So out of these</a>
				<a href="#00:03:24.69" id="00:03:24.69" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(204, this.id)">simple components you get this very powerful structure and then the theorem you want to</a>
				<a href="#00:03:30.25" id="00:03:30.25" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(210, this.id)">prove falls out as a consequence of the overall structure. So it's a kind of architectural</a>
				<a href="#00:03:35.74" id="00:03:35.74" class="lt" onclick="jumptoTime(215, this.id)">style of reasoning which is very powerful and I used that in quantum electrodynamics.</a>
